This online gallery presents the stories that took over the months of 2024; documenting the **mundane and the extraordinary** experiences of people as **part of the society**, the remarkable **local events** supporting the diverse creative industries of La Union, and the **celebration of artistic expression** of my fellow artists.

To learn more about **giography as a business**, you might like to visit the landing page [here](https://giography.vercel.app) or contact Gio directly through the links provided on the footer below.
