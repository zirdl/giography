# Hello there!
I'm **Gio**, an amateur photographer and tech enthusiast based in San Juan, La Union. My forte is mostly on **documentary, event** and **street photography**, but I can also do artistic or commissioned portraits.
I made this minimal website; focusing more on the photographs, to showcase my works and progress as an amateur. Consider bookmarking this website, if you want to visit it from time-to-time and witness my progress.
